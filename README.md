In order to control our vehicle, we used both a Raspberry Pi 4 single-board computer and an Arduino Mega microcontroller. The two boards worked together to handle tasks better suited to each. In this arrangement, the RPi acted as the central decision-maker for the robot, while the Arduino ran a simple script to interact with the sensors/actuators when commanded by the RPi.
